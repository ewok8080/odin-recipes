## Whats in here?
Not really a lot at the moment is the short answer, I'm mainly updating this file to practice getting files from git to git hub (and some markdown syntext also)
### Some command syntext to remember
1. git add - Use this to add the file you want eg. git add README.md
2. git commit -m - Use this to commit the file and add commit message eg. git commit -m "Edit README.md"
3. git push origin main - Use this to push the file to Github
